# Movie Search Engine: A React Project

This project is a simple movie search engine built using React, demonstrating fundamental concepts and serving as a starting point for learning web development.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this project is to provide a hands-on learning experience for individuals interested in web development, specifically using React, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It showcases basic functionalities like fetching data from an API, rendering components, and handling user input. This project can be further expanded upon to include more features and functionalities, encouraging users to experiment and deepen their understanding of the involved technologies.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, enabling component-based development and efficient rendering.
- **JavaScript**: The core programming language of the web, used for logic, data manipulation, and interaction with APIs.
- **HTML**: The markup language for structuring web pages and defining content.
- **CSS**: The styling language used to control the visual appearance of web elements.
- **Axios**: A library for making HTTP requests to fetch data from APIs.
- **React Router**: A library for handling routing and navigation within the React application.

## Features

- Search for movies by title.
- Display a list of movies with their year, rating, and number of votes.
- Basic navigation between home and search results pages.

## Installation

Before getting started, make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system.

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-search-engine.git`
2. Install dependencies: `cd movie-search-engine && npm install`
3. Start the mock API server: `node server.js`
4. Start the React application: `npm start`
5. Access the application: Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

## Expanding the Project

This project can be extended in several ways:

- Implement more advanced search options: Filter by year, genre, or rating.
- Integrate with a real movie database API, such as TMDb or OMDb.
- Add user authentication and favorites list: Allow users to save their favorite movies.
- Improve styling and responsiveness: Enhance the visual design and ensure optimal viewing across different devices.
- Implement pagination for search results: Display results across multiple pages.
- Add movie details page: Provide more information about each movie.

These are just suggestions, and you are encouraged to explore and implement your own ideas as well.

## Project Structure

- `public`: Contains the `index.html` file, the entry point for the application.
- `src`:
  - `components`: Reusable UI components like Header, MovieList, and MovieCard.
  - `pages`: Page components for Home and SearchResults.
  - `services`: Functions for interacting with the API (`movieService.js`).
  - `App.js`: The main application component that sets up routing and renders pages.
  - `index.js`: The entry point for the React application.
- `server.js`: A simple Node.js server providing a mock API for movie data (for development purposes).
- `index.css`: Global styles for the application.

## Conclusion

This Movie Search Engine project offers a valuable starting point for learning React and related web technologies. Its simple structure and clear functionalities make it easy to understand and modify, encouraging users to explore further and build upon the foundation.
